Certainly! Here's an example of computer code that demonstrates the usage of The Perfect Figure Business Secretary GitHub repository:

```html






Welcome to The Perfect Figure Business Secretary






```

In this example, we assume that there is a JavaScript file named `business-secretary.js` hosted on The Perfect Figure GitHub repository. This file contains the necessary code for managing employee data.

The HTML code sets up a basic webpage with a heading and a script tag. Inside the script tag, we create a new instance of the `BusinessSecretary` class from the `business-secretary.js` file. We then define an array of sample employee data and add each employee to the secretary's database using the `addEmployee` method.

Finally, we retrieve all employees using the `getAllEmployees` method and display their names and positions on the webpage using the `document.write` method.
